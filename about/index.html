                  <h4>What is it?</h4>
                  <p>JSConf Hawaiʻi is the newest in the family of JSConf events. For our second year, we're planning to
                    bring about 400 people together for a three-day single track conference. Our goal is that by the time you
                    leave, you'll have seen some new ideas, learned some more JavaScript, and made new friends to keep in touch with.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Being at the conference</h4>
                  <p>The small, single-track nature of the conference means that it's easy to figure out what to do! We'll have lots
                    of time to meet your fellow attendees and share ideas outside of the sessions.</p>
                  <h4>Schedule</h4>
                  <p>We won't have an exact schedule ready until after we've finalized our speaker lineup. But for travel planning purposes,
                    a high level overview is included.</p>
                  <p>On Tuesday night, we'll have check-in and badge pickup in the late-evening along with a casual meetup for you to meet
                    your fellow attendees as they arrive.</p>
                  <p>Don't forget to get some rest as each day will start around 9:00am. We plan on finishing around 5pm, with a few short
                    breaks in the morning and afternoon, along with a longer hour-long break for lunch in the middle; plenty of time to hop
                    in the ocean if you are so inclined.</p>
                  <p>Wednesday evening, post-dinner, we'll have a party for all attendees. We haven't finalized plans yet, so more info closer
                    to the date. We know many of you may be travelling with a companion, and we are happy to announce the event
                    will be open to them as well.</p>
                  <p>Thursday is a "Gap day!" You'll have a choice to stay at the resort for some continued learning opportunities, or
                    venture outside to join some group activities like snorkeling or hiking. We are still finalizing the Gap day options, but 
                    you'll have a chance to vote for your preferred activity when you buy your ticket! We'll announce the final activities as the
                    conferences draws nearer.</p>
                  <h4>Amenities</h4>
                  <p>You can read more about the resort further on, but the location is fairly central to the tourist area of Honolulu, meaning
                    there's a beach across the street, and a Hard Rock Cafe just a few blocks away. Anyone travelling with you will have tons of
                    options available to them nearby from surf lessons, to shopping, to spas.</p>
                  <p>If you are staying at the venue using our discounted rates, you room will be just an elevator ride away should you need to
                    step out and take a break. In addition, we'll have the theater area sectioned off from our "lounge" area, so if you need snacks,
                    coffee, or just want to meet up with a friend, we'll have space for that.</p>
                  <p>There's still a lot of specifics to figure out, but live captioning of the sessions will be available. And on request, we'll
                    have childcare available either on-site or nearby for children.</p>

                <div class="grid-half-first">
                  <p>Hawaiʻi is a chain of islands, so there's really only one way to get there!</p>
                  <h4>Honolulu International Airport</h4>
                  <p>Hawaiʻi's primary airport is located on the west side of Honolulu, and about a 20-30 minute drive
                    to Waikiki where the venue is located. With dozens of airlines and direct flight destinations
                    around 20 million people pass through the airport annually. You should be able to find a flight
                    from almost any hub airport in the US, and several in Asia.</p>
                  <p>If you can't ride-share with some other attendees on your flight, there's also public transit
                    available from the airport to the door of the hotel. The 19, 20, or 42 bus lines all will get
                    the job done, and run roughly every 15 minutes.</p>
                  <p>A multitude of rental car companies are also available at the airport, as well as both Enterprise
                    and Dollar having offices in the conference hotel.</p>
                  <h4>Parking</h4>
                  <p>For attendees staying in the hotel overnight, parkings is:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>$10/night for self park</li>
                    <li>$42/night for valet</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>For day-time only attendees, we have reserved a limited number of free daytime parking passes. 
                    Please email us at attend@jsconfhi.com to request a parking pass.</p>
                  <h4>Getting around</h4>
                  <p>The entire conference will take place in or around the hotel and meeting room venue. The beach
                    is just across the street from our hotel. Our evening party may be a short walk away in Waikiki,
                    but if it's further than that we'll provide shuttles. So plan to not need any transportation if
                    you are staying with us at the Alohilani</p>
                  <p>As there's so much to see around Hawaiʻi, it's worth noting that if you choose to arrive early
                    or stay later, there's two rental car companies available on-premises, so you can easily grab a
                    car after or return yours before the conference.</p>
                  <p>HNL Airport also has frequent flights and connections to other islands that might be of interest,
                    including Maui which is extremely popular with visitors.
