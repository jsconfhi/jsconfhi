            All submissions are anonymized before review in an attempt to remove
            any conscious or unconscious biases towards the submitter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The top submissions are then de-anonymized so we can take speaker
            details into account. We may also do a second round and request a
            short video of you pitching your idea to help us learn more about
            you and your talk.

        <H2>Details</H2>
        <p>
          We are inviting the JS community to help us make JSConf Hawaiʻi an
          amazing experience by submitting your talk for consideration at our
          inaugural conference February 7-8, 2019. We are looking to uncover new
          ideas and concepts, along with novel usages, that push the boundaries
          of JavaScript or help strengthen the JavaScript community.
        </p>

        <H2>Topics</H2>
        <p>
          JSConf Hawaiʻi does not have a specific themes for talks. Our goal in
          this process is to select a broad range of topics that would appeal to
          as many JavaScript developers as possible. We welcome unusual,
          strange, non-traditional, or even non-JS presentations as long as they
          remain within the boundaries of our{" "}
          <Link style={{ color: theme.colors.textYellow }} to="/about#coc">
            Code of Conduct
          </Link>{" "}
          and in general benefit this community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Talks should be in English and if you’ve already given your talk at a
          small conference, that’s ok, but we would appreciate if it can be
          updated with fresh and original examples for this unique conference!
          You are welcome to submit multiple topics or ideas for consideration,
          however you can only present once.
        </p>

        <p>
          All talks should be 25-30 minutes in length. If you feel you have a
          talk that would benefit from a longer or shorter period of time,
          please note that on your submission notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We expect these sessions to constitue a majority if not all of our
          content. We've left other submission options available for unique or
          standout suggestions for content. But please note: we may not be able
          to pay your expenses for other types of content. However, we're happy
          to discuss ideas.
        </p>

        <H2>The Process</H2>
        <p>
          All submissions are anonymized before review in an attempt to remove
          any conscious or unconscious biases towards the submitter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top submissions are then de-anonymized so we can take speaker
          details into account. If needed, we may also do a second round and
          request a short video of you pitching your idea to help us learn more
          about you and your talk.
        </p>

        <p>
          All selected speakers are expected to have 2 calls with an organizer:
          one content outline discussion and conference info chat about 2 months
          prior (early December), and one more concrete dry-run and update
          roughly 2 weeks prior.
        </p>

        <H2>Diversity</H2>
        <p>
          We encourage first-time speakers to apply, don’t be shy! We are happy
          to work with you on your presentation and speaking skills to make sure
          you’re successful with a larger audience.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are seeking to build a diverse lineup from all types of people and
          experiences. We do this in part by asking for some demographic
          information on the submission page. All submissions will be anonymised
          of personal and demographic information to remove any conscious or
          unconscious biases towards the submitter.
        </p>

        <H2>Perks</H2>
        <p>
          Selected speakers will have the full cost of attending covered if
          their companies do not fund events, including conference ticket, three
          nights hotel, and airfare, along with taxi to/from airport. Certain
          incidentals or outside meals may be at your own expense. If you
          previously purchased a ticket and are selected to speak, you will have
          the full cost of your ticket refunded. So please do not let applying
          to speak cause you to miss out on attending.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a speaker you will have a direct point of contact to help with
          travel, AV, and all those other fun logistical points. Childcare will
          be available on request for speakers. We will be recording and
          transcribing your talks as well, so you’ll have a great addition to
          your speaker resume that you can share with the broader community.
          More details to come from the speaker point of contact.
        </p>

        <H2>Requirements</H2>
        <p>
          We ask that if selected, you provide a bio, photo and description for
          our site and program. We want to hype up your talk! The conference
          will post a video of your talk for the broader community on YouTube.
          We may use video / pictures / likenesses of you and your talk in
          future promotional materials. You must comply with the Code of Conduct
          both before and at the conference.
