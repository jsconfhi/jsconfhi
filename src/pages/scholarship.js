                    Diversity and an inclusive environment are two of JSConf
                    Hawai'i's core values, because we believe a broader variety
                    of people enriches the conference through a broader variety
                    of perspectives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, we recognize that it can be difficult for people
                    traditionally underrepresented in tech to set aside the
                    resources for a conference in Hawai'i. We don't want to lose
                    those perspectives, so we offer an Opportunity Scholarship
                    for members of those groups who might not be able to attend
                    otherwise.
                  </p>
                  <p>The scholarship includes some or all of the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Discounted or free JSConfHI ticket</li>
                    <li>Fully covered accomodations (up to 4 nights)</li>

                  <h4>Who is Eligible for an Opportunity Scholarship?</h4>
                  <p>
                    The JSConf Hawaii Opportunity Scholarships are intended to
                    increase the diversity of perspectives at the conference.
                    Our primary method is to subsidize members of communities
                    that are traditionally underrepresented in tech, and who
                    wouldn't be able to attend without financial assistance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Underrepresented groups include (but are not limited to):
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Hawai'i Residents</li>
                    <li>LGBTQIA+</li>
                    <li>Women</li>
                    <li>Persons of Color</li>
                    <li>Persons with Disabilities</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The group identification portion of the application is a
                    text field. If you are a part of an underrepresented group
                    we have not identified, please feel free to apply and list
                    it!
                  </p>
                  <h4>How Much Work is the Application Process?</h4>
                  <p>
                    We have streamlined the application process compared to
                    JSConfHI 2019. This year are only asking for demographic
                    data, what you need, and two fields asking what you hope to
                    get out of the conference, and how you are currently
                    involved in the tech community. We recommend 200-500 words
                    for the two question sections so we can learn about you and
                    how to best meet your needs!
                  </p>
                  <h4>When Will I Find Out If I Got the Scholarship?</h4>
                  <p>
                    The JSConfHI team is aiming to announce scholarship
                    recepients in mid-November. We have a policy of informing
                    both those who received the scholarship and those who
                    didn't, so no one is left wondering.
                  </p>
                  <h4>
                    What if I already bought a ticket? What if I really, really
                    want to come?
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    Opportunity Scholarships are not guaranteed. We will give as
                    much as we can, but it's likely we'll have more requests
                    than we can fulfill.
                  </p>
