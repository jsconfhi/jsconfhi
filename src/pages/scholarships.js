                        Diversity and an inclusive environment are two of JSConf
                        Hawai'i's core values, because we believe a broader
                        variety of people enriches the conference through a
                        broader variety of perspectives.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, we recognize that it can be difficult for
                        people traditionally underrepresented in tech to set
                        aside the resources for a conference in Hawai'i. We
                        don't want to lose those perspectives, so we offer an
                        Opportunity Scholarship for members of those groups who
                        might not be able to attend otherwise.

                      <h3>Who is Eligible for an Opportunity Scholarship?</h3>
                      <p>
                        The JSConf Hawaii Opportunity Scholarships are intended
                        to increase the diversity of perspectives at the
                        conference. Our primary method is to subsidize members
                        of communities that are traditionally underrepresented
                        in tech, and who wouldn't be able to attend without
                        financial assistance.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Underrepresented groups include (but are not limited
                        to):
                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Hawai'i Residents</li>
                        <li>LGBTQIA+</li>
                        <li>Women</li>
                        <li>Persons of Color</li>
                        <li>Persons with Disabilities</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        The group identification portion of the application is a
                        text field. If you are a part of an underrepresented
                        group we have not identified, please feel free to apply
                        and list it!
                      </p>
                      <h3>How Much Work is the Application Process?</h3>
                      <p>
                        We have streamlined the application process compared to
                        JSConfHI 2019. This year are only asking for demographic
                        data, what you need, and two fields asking what you hope
                        to get out of the conference, and how you are currently
                        involved in the tech community. We recommend 200-500
                        words for the two question sections so we can learn
                        about you and how to best meet your needs!
                      </p>
                      <h3>When Will I Find Out If I Got the Scholarship?</h3>
                      <p>
                        The JSConfHI team is aiming to announce scholarship
                        recepients in mid-November. We have a policy of
                        informing both those who received the scholarship and
                        those who didn't, so no one is left wondering.
                      </p>
                      <h3>
                        What if I already bought a ticket? What if I really,
                        really want to come?
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Opportunity Scholarships are not guaranteed. We will
                        give as much as we can, but it's likely we'll have more
                        requests than we can fulfill.
