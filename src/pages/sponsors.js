        With over 400 developers from around the world attending, and hundreds
        more following along at home, sponsoring the conference is one of the
        best ways to connect with JavaScript developers.

      <div>
        There are a variety of sponsorship packages available for small and
        large companies alike! From setting up a developer lounge on-site, to
        hosting a meal, to reaching our eager Twitter audience, to being
        recognized as one of our "Diversity Sponsors" who help bring attendees
        to the conference, there's a huge range of benefits to take advantage
        of, and not all of them require you to attend in-person.
