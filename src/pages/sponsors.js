                With over 400 developers from around the world attending, and
                hundreds more following along at home, sponsoring the conference
                is one of the best ways to connect with JavaScript developers.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are a variety of sponsorship packages available for small
                and large companies alike! From setting up a developer lounge
                on-site, to hosting a meal, to reaching our eager Twitter
                audience, to being recognized as one of our "Diversity Sponsors"
                who help bring attendees to the conference, there's a huge range
                of benefits to take advantage of, and not all of them require
                you to attend in-person.
              </p>
